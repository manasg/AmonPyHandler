What is this?
=============
- Python Log Handler for Amon.cx

Why?
====
- Amon already provides a py client - http://amon.cx/guide/clients/python/
- BUT A log handler acts as a wrapper - so if I move to another system, I just need to change the handler code
- More WHYs are here - https://github.com/manasg/AmonLogging

Dependencies
============
- Amonpy - I used pip to install it

Usage
=====
There are examples under test/ 

ToDo
====
Distribute as egg?
